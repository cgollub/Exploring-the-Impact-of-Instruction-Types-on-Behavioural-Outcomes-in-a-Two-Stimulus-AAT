# Exploring the Impact of Instruction Types on Behavioural Outcomes  
## A Two-Stimulus Approach–Avoidance Task (AAT)

This repository contains all code used for the behavioural analyses conducted in my bachelor thesis:

> **“Exploring the Impact of Instruction Types on Behavioural Outcomes in a Two-Stimulus Approach–Avoidance Task”.**

The project investigates how **implicit vs explicit task instructions** influence behavioural approach–avoidance effects measured via **reaction time** and **accuracy**, using mixed-effects models and exploratory stimulus analyses in R.

This thesis is part of a larger research project led by **Aitana Grasso-Cladera** at the **University of Osnabrück**.  
The experimental data and the Word document protocols included in the `Implicit Preprocessing` and `Explicit Preprocessing` folders were provided as part of this project.

## Repository Structure

This project is organized into the following main folders:

├─ Behavioural Analysis/
│ Contains scripts for performing the behavioural analyses on preprocessed data
│ (e.g., Reaction Time and Accuracy modelling and plotting).

├─ Explicit Preprocessing/
│ Contains preprocessing code and documentation for Experiment 2 (Explicit task).

├─ Implicit Preprocessing/
│ Contains preprocessing code and documentation for Experiment 1 (Implicit task).

├─ README.md
└─ .gitignore



Each preprocessing folder includes:
- An R script implementing the preprocessing pipeline
- A supervisor-provided Word document outlining the intended protocol
- A README explaining what the code does and how to run it

## Main Analyses

The `Behavioural Analysis/` folder includes:
- Scripts that load the preprocessed datasets generated by the preprocessing folders
- Mixed-effects modelling of reaction time (`RT`) and accuracy
- Plotting code for results presented in the thesis

---

## How to Use

1. **Preprocess the raw data**  
   - Place your raw `.mat` files in the appropriate folder (Implicit or Explicit).
   - Update file paths in the preprocessing scripts.
   - Run the preprocessing script to generate CSV data  
     (e.g., `experiment_1_preprocessing.csv`, `experiment_2_preprocessed.csv`).

2. **Run behavioural analyses**  
   - Open the scripts in `Behavioural Analysis/`.
   - Ensure the paths to preprocessed CSVs are correct.
   - Execute in R/RStudio to reproduce the results.

## Requirements

This repository requires:
- **R (≥ 4.3.0)**
- The following R packages (at minimum):
  - `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `lme4`, `cowplot`, `tibble`, `R.matlab`  
- Additional packages are listed at the top of each script.

---

## Notes

- **Raw data (`.mat` files) are not included** due to ethical and privacy constraints.
- Preprocessing steps follow the supervised protocol and include diagnostic summaries and plots.
- Each folder contains a README describing the corresponding workflow in detail.

## Acknowledgements

This code and documentation were developed for a Bachelor of Science thesis conducted at the  
**Neurobiopsychology Research Group, Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück**.
