# Instruction-dependent Approach–Avoidance Bias

This repository contains the analysis code for my bachelor thesis:

**“Exploring the Impact of Instruction Types on Behavioural Outcomes in a Two-Stimulus Approach-Avoidance Task”**

## Project description
The project investigates how implicit versus explicit task instructions influence behavioural approach–avoidance effects using reaction time and accuracy measures.

The analyses were conducted in **R** using mixed-effects models and exploratory stimulus-level analyses.

## Repository structure
- `data/` – preprocessed behavioural data (not raw data)
- `scripts/` – R scripts for preprocessing, analysis, and plotting
- `figures/` – generated figures used in the thesis
- `functions/` – helper functions used across analyses

## Requirements
- R (≥ 4.3.0)
- Packages: lme4, tidyverse, ggplot2, lmerTest

## Notes
This repository is intended for academic documentation purposes.
